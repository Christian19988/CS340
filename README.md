Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Programs:
I keep my code clear, organized, and easy to update by using simple names and breaking it into parts. In Project One, I created a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Python module, which made it easy to connect to dashboard widgets in Project Two. By keeping each part focused, the module was easy to test and reuse. I can now use this CRUD module for any future projects that need database actions, saving time.

Approaching Problems as a Computer Scientist:
When solving problems, I start by fully understanding what’s needed, then break the solution into steps. For the database and dashboard tasks from Grazioso Salvare, I figured out how each widget would use the database, making sure the CRUD module could handle it all. This was more practical and user-focused than past assignments. In future projects, I’d design databases that are flexible and easy to update for other client needs.

Role and Importance of Computer Scientists:
Computer scientists create tools that save time, improve accuracy, and make tasks easier. For Grazioso Salvare, my work helped streamline operations by connecting data to a user-friendly dashboard. This setup can help companies work faster, make fewer mistakes, and focus more on their goals.
